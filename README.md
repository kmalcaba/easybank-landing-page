# Easybank Landing Page

This is a solution to the [Easybank landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN).

The landing page is responsive as well, try it out!

## My process

I procrastinated this for like 3 months (to be fair, I was doing other projects at the time) but I finally got it done! I think the hardest part was the hero section, trying to line up the images and the text properly. I ended up using CSS grid for this one, which worked well enough. Otherwise, everything was fairly easy to build with flexbox and grid.

### Built with

- ReactJS
- styled-components

## Continued development

The mobile navigation menu could definitely use improvement, like its positioning and animations. Right now, it looks weird when the menu is open and you scroll down the page. It's stuck in the middle of the page because its position is fixed. I could also use framer-motion for an entry animation.
